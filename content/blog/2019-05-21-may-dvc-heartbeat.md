## News and links

This section of DVC Heartbeat is growing with every new Issue and this is
already quite a good piece of news!

One of the most exciting things we want to share this month is acceptance of DVC
into the [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/).
It is a new and unique program sponsored by Google that pairs technical writers
with open source projects to collaborate and improve the open source project
documentation. You can find the outline of DVC vision and project ideas in
[this dedicated blogpost](https://blog.dataversioncontrol.com/dvc-project-ideas-for-google-summer-of-docs-2019-defe3a73b248)
and check the
[full list of participating open source organisations](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants/).
Technically the
[program is starting in a few months](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/timeline),
but there is already a fantastic increase in the amount of commits and
contributors, and we absolutely love it!

The other important milestone for us was the first offline meeting with our
distributed remote team. Working side by side and having non-Zoom meetings with
the team was amazing. Joining our forces to prepare for the upcoming conferences
turned out to be the most valuable, educating and uniting experience for the
whole team.

It’s a shame that our techlead was unable to join us it due to another visa
denial. We do hope he will finally make it to the USA for the next big
conference.

While we were busy finalizing all the Pycon 2019 prep, our own
[Dmitry Petrov](undefined) flew to New York to speak at the
[O’Reilly AI Conference](https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny)
about the
[Open Source tools for Machine Learning Models and Datasets versioning](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-conference/9781492050544/video324691.html).
Unfortunately the video is available for the registered users only (with a free
trial option) but you can have a look at Dmitry’s slides
[here](https://www.slideshare.net/DmitryPetrov15/dvc-oreilly-artificial-intelligence-conference-2019-new-york).

We renamed our Twitter! Our old handle was a bit misleading and we moved from
@Iterativeai to @DVCorg (yet keep the old one for future projects).

Our team is so happy every time we discover an article featuring DVC or
addressing one of the burning ML issues we are trying to solve. Here are some of
our favorite links from the past month:

## Discord gems

There are lots of hidden gems in our Discord community discussions. Sometimes
they are scattered all over the channels and hard to track down.

We are sifting through the issues and discussions and share with you the most
interesting takeaways.

### This might be [a favourite gem of ours ](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485598848111083531/572960640122224640) — our engineers are so fast that someone assumed they were bots.

We feared that too until we met them in person. They appeared to be real (unless
bots also love Ramen now)!

![](/uploads/post_images/bots-also-love-ramen-now.png)

### [Is this the best way to track data with DVC when code and data are separate?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/572974117351849997) Having being burned by this a couple of times, i.e accidentally pushing large

files to GitHub, I now keep my code and data separate

Every time you run `dvc add` to start tracking some data artifact, its path is
automatically added to the `.gitignore` file, as a result it is hard to commit
it to git by mistake — you would need to explicitly modify the `.gitignore`
first. The feature to track some external data is called
[external outputs](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/external-outputs) (if all you
need is to track some data artifacts). Usually it is used when you have some
data on S3 or SSH and don’t want to pull it into your working space, but it’s
working even when your data is located on the same machine outside of the
repository.

### [How do I wrap a step that downloads a file/directory into a DVC stage?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/571342592508428289) I want to ensure that it runs only if file has no been downloaded yet

Use `dvc import` to track and download the remote data first time and next time
when you do dvc repro if data has changed remotely. If you don’t want to track
remote changes (lock the data after it was downloaded), use `dvc run` with a
dummy dependency (any text file will do you do not touch) that runs an actual
wget/curl to get the data.

### [How do I show a pipeline that does not have a default Dvcfile?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/570943786151313408) (e.g. I assigned all files names manually with `-f` in the `dvc run` command and I just don’t have Dvcfile anymore)

Almost any command in DVC that deals with pipelines (set of DVC-files) accepts a
single stage as a target, for example dvc pipeline show — ascii model.dvc.

### [DVC hangs or I’m getting “database is locked” issue](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/570843482218823682)

It’s a well known problem with NFS, CIFS (Azure) — they do not support file
locks properly which is required by the SQLLite engine to operate. The easiest
workaround — don’t create a DVC project on network attached partition. In
certain cases a fix can be made by changing mounting options, check
[this discussion](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/570276668694855690)
for the Azure ML Service.

### [How do I use DVC if I use a separate drive to store the data](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/570091809594671126) (and a small/fast SSD to run computations)? I don’t have enough space to bring data to my working space

An excellent question! The short answer is:

`dvc cache dir --local` — to move your data to a big partition;

`dvc config cache.type reflink, hardlink, symlink, copy` — to enable symlinks to
avoid actual copying;

`dvc config cache.protected true` — it’s highly recommended to make links in
your working space read-only to avoid corrupting the cache;

To add your data first time to the DVC cache, do a clone of the repository on a
big partition and run `dvc add` to add your data. Then you can do `git pull`,
`dvc pull` on a small partition and DVC will create all the necessary links.

### [Why I’m getting `Paths for outs overlap` error when I run `dvc add` or `dvc run`?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/571335064374345749)

Usually it means that a parent directory of one of the arguments for dvc add /
dvc run is already tracked. For example, you’ve added the whole datasets
directory already. And now you are trying to add a subdirectory, which is
already tracked as a part of the datasets one. No need to do that. You could
`dvc add datasets` or `dvc repro datasets.dvc` to save changes.

### [I’m getting `ascii codec can’t encode character` error on DVC commands when I deal with unicode file names](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/567310354766495747)

[Check the locale settings you have](https://perlgeek.de/en/article/set-up-a-clean-utf8-environment)
(locale command in Linux). Python expects a locale that can handle unicode
printing. Usually it’s solved with these commands: `export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`
and `export LANG=en_US.UTF-8`. You can place those exports into `.bashrc` or
other file that defines your environment.

### [Does DVC use the same logins aws-cli has when using an S3 bucket as its repo/remote storage](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/563149775340568576)?

In short — yes, but it can be also configured. DVC is going to use either your
default profile (from `~/.aws/*`) or your env vars by default. If you need more
flexibility (e.g. you need to use different credentials for different projects,
etc) check out
[this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html)
to configure custom aws profiles and then you could use them with DVC using
these
[remote options](https://dvc.org/doc/commands-reference/remote-add#options).

### [How can I output multiple metrics from a single file?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/566000729505136661) Let’s say I have the following in a file: `{“AUC_RATIO”: {“train”: 0.8922748258797667, “valid”: 0.8561602726251776, “xval”: 0.8843431199314923}}`. How can I show both train and valid without xval?

You can use metrics show command XPath option and provide multiple attribute
names to it:

```dvc
$ dvc metrics add model.metrics --type json --xpath AUC_RATIO[train,valid]
    metrics.json:
                 0.89227482588
                 0.856160272625
```

### [What is the quickest way to add a new dependency to a DVC-file?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/566314479499870211)

There are a few options to add a new dependency:

- simply opening a file with your favorite editor and adding a dependency there
  without md5. DVC will understand that that stage is changed and will re-run
  and re-calculate md5 checksums during the next dvc repro;

- use `dvc run --no-exec` is another option. It will rewrite the existing file
  for you with new parameters.

### [Is there a way to add a dependency to a python package, so it runs a stage again if it imported the updated library?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/566315265646788628)

The only recommended way so far would be to somehow make DVC know about your
package’s version. One way to do that would be to create a separate stage that
would be dynamically printing version of that specific package into a file, that
your stage would depend on:

```dvc
$ dvc run -o mypkgver 'pip show mypkg > mypkgver’
$ dvc run -d mypkgver -d ... -o .. mycmd
```

### [Is there anyway to forcibly recompute the hashes of dependencies in a pipeline DVC-file?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/564807276146458624)

E.g. I made some whitespace/comment changes in my code and I want to tell dvc
“it’s ok, you don’t have to recompute everything”.

Yes, you could `dvc commit -f`. It will save all current checksum without
re-running your commands.

### I[ have projects that use data that’s stored in S3. I never have data locally to use `dvc push`, but I would like to have this data version controlled.](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/563352000281182218) Is there a way to use the features of DVC in this use case?

Yes! This DVC features is called
[external outputs](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/external-outputs) and
[external dependencies](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/external-dependencies).
You can use one of them or both to track, process, and version your data on a
cloud storage without downloading it locally.
